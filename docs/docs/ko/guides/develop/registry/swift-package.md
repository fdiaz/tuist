# Swift package {#swift-package}

If you are working on a Swift package, you can use the `--replace-scm-with-registry` flag to resolve dependencies from the registry if they are available:

```bash
swift package --replace-scm-with-registry resolve
```

If you want to ensure that the registry is used every time you resolve dependencies, you will need to update `dependencies` in your `Package.swift` file to use the registry identifier instead of a URL. 레지스트리 식별자는 `{organization}.{repository}` 형식을 가집니다. For example, to use the registry for the `swift-composable-architecture` package, do the following:

```diff
dependencies: [
-   .package(url: "https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture", from: "0.1.0")
+   .package(id: "pointfreeco.swift-composable-architecture", from: "0.1.0")
]
```
